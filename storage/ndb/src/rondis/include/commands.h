    STYLE GUIDE:
    From a RonDB perspective, this file is where transactions are created and
    removed again. The data operations inbetween are done in db_operations.
    This avoids redundant calls to `ndb->closeTransaction(trans);` and therefore
    also reduces the risk to forget calling this function (causing memory leaks).

    The db_operations level however handles most of the low-level NdbError handling.
    Most importantly, it writes Ndb error messages to the response string. This may
    however change in the future, since this causes redundancy.
